# Silk assignment

### by Brandon Pliska

#### A few notes to keep in mind about this

- I enjoyed this exercise quite a bit, although I didn't get to put in all of the things I would have done in a real product, I feel this is a good indicator of my skill since this was about a 7 hour project
- I was not able to get to write many unit tests that I would have, especially for the calculations, I apologize if that's a negative.
- This was built with Nx (nx.dev) using Vite. I didn't use the `libs`` directory as this project is small, but Nx does such a good job with build configurations out of the box it seemed like a good move to use it anyways.
- I am confident I can immediately contribute with your team given the nature of the subject matter, I'm very familiar with findings and how they change frequently and I'm also aware of changing UX that can make for much easier consumption by users, since the data can be hard to understand at first
- The SPA is in React
  - Located in `apps/dashboard/src/app`
- THe backend is in NestJS and Mongo Atlas
  - Located in `apps/findings/src`
    - NOTE: I decided for this exercise gRPC or GraphQL are overkill, so I just set up basic GET endpoints
    - NOTE: code is mostly in `findings` dir
- The Mongo database has permissions that are readonly for this exercise only so the development.env file is not putting anything at risk
- I thought about adding a `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile`. If you'd like I can add it
- I added a `run.sh` bash script that will run the 2 apps in parallel and should make for an easy review
- I hope to speak with you soon! ðŸ¤ž
